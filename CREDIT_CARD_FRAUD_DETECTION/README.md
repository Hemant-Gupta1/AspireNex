# Features
This project aims to detect fraudulent transactions using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier.

# Overview

Credit card fraud detection is crucial in minimizing financial losses due to unauthorized transactions. This project focuses on building machine learning models to detect fraud effectively. The dataset used in this project contains transactions that are labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. Given the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, this project implements undersampling and oversampling strategies to handle the imbalance.

# Project Goals:

    Understand and explore the credit card transaction dataset.
    Preprocess the data to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and feature scaling.
    Address the class imbalance issue using both undersampling and oversampling techniques.
    Train and evaluate machine learning models (Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier).
    Compare the performance of models with different resampling techniques.
    Achieve a high-accuracy model for fraud detection (final accuracy: 91.965%).

# Project Pipeline

    Data Loading: Load the dataset from a CSV file.
    Data Exploration: Explore the dataset with descriptive statistics and visualizations.
    Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, duplicates, and scale features.
    Resampling: Apply undersampling and oversampling techniques to balance the classes.
    Model Training: Train and evaluate Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier models.
    Model Evaluation: Assess the models using accuracy and classification reports.

# Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates that resampling techniques, such as oversampling, help in building effective fraud detection models for highly imbalanced datasets. Logistic Regression performs well in detecting fraudulent transactions with high accuracy, precision, and recall.

By using resampling, we ensure that the model generalizes better, reducing the risk of overfitting and improving its ability to detect fraudulent transactions.
